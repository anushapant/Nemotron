## What is Nemotron?

[NVIDIA Nemotron™](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemotron) is a family of open, high-efficiency models with fully transparent training data, weights, and recipes.

Nemotron models are designed for **agentic AI workflows** — they excel at coding, math, scientific reasoning, tool calling, instruction following, and visual reasoning (for the VL models).

They are optimized for deployment across a spectrum of compute tiers (edge, single GPU, data center) and support frameworks like NeMo and TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, and SGLang, with NIM microservice options for scalable serving.
